Hello, if for some reason you are reading this, this is a very basic project that i did as a way to practice my programming skills, i will comeback to this and try to improve it.

*Missing better colors for the calculator

*Missing some QoL features

      -Like the ability to add more than one operator
  
     -Not showing the input when the user clicks the '.' button
  
     -Limiting the amoun of operator the user can input
  
     -Removing the buttons in the input that go dawn 0.1 each time any of the buttons are pressed
